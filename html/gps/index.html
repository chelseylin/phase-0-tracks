<!--The purpose of the HTML5 semantic tags are to give a more organized structure of the content on the web. I think the most useful ones are the tags such as section and nav. I think the browser reads the code from up to down and display it accordingly, but each element may not appear in order because their position may be affected by styling. Also, I learned how to use sublime snippet, which is a really useful tool. I will definitely create more snippet as time goes. THe most difficult part is to understand the semantic meaning of the main tag since it's a little abstract. However I managed to understand it in the end.-->
