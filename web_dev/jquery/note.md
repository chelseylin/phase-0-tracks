#Preparation#

1. Google and find a page with quick tutorial on basic JQuery commands and functions
2. Test each commands and functions separately.
3. Take a short break every 15 minutes to refresh my memory.
4. Try out some of the commands myself until I feel confident.
5. Search other quick cheat-sheets and expand my knowledge on JQuery

#Conclusion#

I still used the W3School websites because they have really good explanation on everything and offer you a lot of examples and even quizzes to study for. I think I still have a lot more to learn. If I have idea about a certain function I want to employee, I can always search and learn it, and I think it is better than going over textbook and try to learn everything at once.
