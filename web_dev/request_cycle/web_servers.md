#1 Design Philosophies of Linux#

The main philosophy of Linux and Unix systems is that they believe their users know what they are doing and are computer literates. They believe that an operating system should not stop its users from doing stupid things because it will also prevent them achieving clever things. This is very different from other familiar systems such as Windows and OS because their goal is to shield users from the complexity of computer and any action that may cause users trouble.

#2 VPS and advantages#

It is a VM(virtual machine) that we can buy from some companies who sell Internet hosting services. It is like a computer with its own operating system and memories without a physical body. We can interact with it using command lines just like using real computer. One of the advantage is that it is cheaper than a physical server. Also, we can control the server ourselves, therefore we can do anything we want and have a lot more control than to share hosting with someone else.

#3 Root Users for Linux#

Since the root is the ultimate most powerful "user" or manager of the system, it has the highest administrative power to operate any command. Therefore, it is even possible to damage the core of the system by logging in as the root users, which may cause us a lot of troubles when we are not familiar with everything of Linux yet.
